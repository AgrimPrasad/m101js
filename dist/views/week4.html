Because opcode only eliminates about 1/5 of the data, whereas timestamp could have millions of per opcode.</p><h2>Hinting an Index</h2><p>Normally mongo makes its own decisions what index to use, but you can also tell it which to use</p><pre>&gt; db.foo.find({a:"hello"}).hint({a:1,b:1,c:1})</pre><p>You can also tell mongo not to use an index at all</p><pre>&gt; db.foo.find({a:"hello"}).hint({$natural:1})</pre><h3>Hinting in Node.js</h3><p>Explain can also be used in the driver</p><pre>
      var cursor = db.collection('coll').find({'x':2}); // defines query
